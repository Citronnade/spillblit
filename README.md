# Features of spillblit
* spillblit is an app designed to split bills between multiple people
* includes tax and tip

# How to use:
* One person creates a table
* After creating a table, a table id will be located in the url bar after " http://citronnade.mooo.com/table/"
* Other people at the table should join the table using a table id and using a unique name
* Everyone enters in how many dollars/coins are in their wallet
* One person enters in price of bill
* Everyone enters in the price of how much they owe (in the past)
* And Wa La, the results table on the page will indicate what they need to put in the pile in the middle of the table to pay the bill that what they need to take out
* NOTE: calculations are not entirely accurate in that the app rounds up; some calculations will not make everyone debtless (some people may owe others, but these values are listed underneath the results table)
